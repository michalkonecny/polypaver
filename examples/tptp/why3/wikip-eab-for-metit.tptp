% This file has been provided by Claude Marche in May 2015 to help support PolyPaver and Why3 integration.
% This is a file generated by Why3 for Metitarski.
% It is a problem that at that time appeared on PolyPaver homepage.  
% It can be solved by PolyPaver using the following parameters:
% -d 2 -m 10
