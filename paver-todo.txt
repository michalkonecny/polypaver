[DONE] fix the slowdown introduced with ppBoxes

[DONE] add a preprocessor that drops hypotheses that do not mention any of the variables in the conclusions

[DONE] cabalise all PolyPaver and the required hsreals modules

[DONE] remember and use for any human communication meaningful variable names

[DONE] keep a boolean indicator with each box whether it is skewed
  [DONE] use this info to get rid of the "(possibly skewed)" in output
  [DONE] use this info to speed up construction of affine maps when they are projections

[DONE] use depth-first search by default

[DONE] report queue size only when using depth-first
  better solution : factor out all string literals into reporting cases

[DONE] report maximum queue size in the end

[DONE] increase the default depth bound to 1000 to make it ineffective
  should be -1/0 really, at least when using fixed-precision endpoints

[DONE] when hitting the depth bound, report it more explicitly
  could be improved, reporting should be more structured

[DONE] add executable "polypaver" that takes siv and a VC name and tries to solve it
  (later it will also be able to take a tptp file)

[DONE] switch -g to take an int parameter - a limit on the box edge ratio, 0 = no limit, 1 = dummy splitting

add spark verification examples to the bundle - sqrt, rr (name it peak)
