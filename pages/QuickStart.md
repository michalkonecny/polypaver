Assuming you have downloaded a compatible binary and installed dependencies (see [this guide](Installation.html)),
you can start using PolyPaver to decide conjectures defined in .pp or .tptp files.

We recommend you to start with the examples in folders 
[examples/pp](https://github.com/michalkonecny/polypaver/tree/master/examples/pp)
and [examples/tptp](https://github.com/michalkonecny/polypaver/tree/master/examples/tptp).

Each of these examples contains information
on what PolyPaver parameter values lead to a proof in reasonable time.
