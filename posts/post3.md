Recently PolyPaver has gained support for a variant of the TPTP language similar to the variant supported by MetiTarski.

I have also added two [example formulas in TPTP format](https://github.com/michalkonecny/polypaver/tree/master/examples/tptp) 
that PolyPaver can prove.  
One was generated by Why3 and the other one an edited version of a formula from the MetiTarski collection.
